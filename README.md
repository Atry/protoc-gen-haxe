protoc-gen-haxe
===============

'''protoc-gen-haxe''' is the Protocol Buffers implementation in [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org/).

## Motive

I am the also author of [protoc-gen-as3](https://code.google.com/p/protoc-gen-as3/),
which is the best Protocol Buffers implementation in ActionScript 3.
But `protoc-gen-haxe` is not a port from `protoc-gen-as3`.
`protoc-gen-haxe` is very different from `protoc-gen-as3`:

| | protoc-gen-as3 | protoc-gen-haxe |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Cross-platform | No. It only runs in Adobe Flash Player or Adobe AIR. | Yes. `protoc-gen-haxe` can run in Flash Players, browsers, servers, and even in Haxe compiler macros. |
| Run Time Type Information | Little, via native Flash API. | Yes. By parsing DescriptorProtoSet at runtime, users can access full information in `.proto`. |
| Mutable message | Yes | Yes |
| Readonly message | No | Yes |
| Will unused code be eliminated? | No | Yes |
| Can users generate their custom code? | No. The user has to create another Protocol Buffers plugin. | Yes. The user can use `protoc-gen-haxe` API in Haxe macro |
| Self-hosting | No. `protoc-gen-as3`'s compiler is written in Java. | Yes. Both compiler and runtime library of `protoc-gen-haxe` are written in Haxe. Even [20% lines of source code](https://github.com/Atry/protoc-gen-haxe/tree/master/haxelib-release/com/dongxiguo/protobuf/compiler/bootstrap) are generated by `protoc-gen-haxe` itself! |
